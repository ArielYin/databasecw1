Modelling
=========

+ Submission is complete and in the correct format 
+ Good choice of case study and scope
+ Use cases correspond to the diagram and the situation being modelled
+ Good choice of use cases
+ C-D script runs correctly
+ Script implements the diagram

- In the diagram, the entity Join_in only describes a standard many-to-many relationship between User and Cgroup.  This could more simply be described by a line.  Similar comments apply to the entity Belong.
- In use case 1, there may be several Cgroup with the same title (there is no UNIQUE constraint on title), so the query may return users from multiple groups.
- Similarly, in use case 2, there may be two different users with nickname Hongkang and album name Birthday (this combination is not unique).  This query will display the photos from both together.

Normalisation
=============

+ Submission is complete
+ Correct identification of candidate keys
+ Correct identification of key and non-key attributes
+ Correct determination of normal forms
+ Sound justification for determination
+ Correct normalisations

- How normalised are your new schemas?  BCNF?

Census
6. Incorrect column name - case sensitivity often matters for downstream systems 
7. Case issue again - Name for "ALL" should be "All"
